## Installation

`gem install time_frame`

## Usage

You can create a `TimeFrame` instance by specifying `min` and `max`

```ruby
time_frame = TimeFrame.new(min: Time.now, max: Time.now + 1.day)
```

or just by specifying a `min` and `duration`

```ruby
time_frame = TimeFrame.new(min: Time.now, duration: 1.day)
```

###Important:
TimeFrame doesn't support Date class.

## Let's play around a bit...

Create a time frame instance from today with duration of 1 day
```ruby
time_frame = TimeFrame.new(min: Time.now, duration: 1.day)
# => 2014-05-07 14:58:47 +0200..2014-05-08 14:58:47 +0200
```

Get the duration
```ruby
time_frame.duration
# => 86400.0 seconds
```

Shift the whole time frame by... let's say... 2 days!
```ruby
later = time_frame.shift_by(2.days)
# => 2014-05-09 14:58:47 +0200..2014-05-10 14:58:47 +0200
```

Shifting can also be done in the other direction...
```ruby
earlier = time_frame.shift_by(-2.days)
# => 2014-05-05 14:58:47 +0200..2014-05-06 14:58:47 +0200
```

Is another time covered by our time frame?
```ruby
my_time = Time.new(2014, 5, 7, 16)
time_frame.cover?(my_time)
# => true
```

Shifting to another time... duration remains:
```ruby
time_frame.shift_to(Time.new(2016, 1, 1))
# => 2016-01-01 00:00:00 +0100..2016-01-02 00:00:00 +0100
```

Checking whether another time frame overlaps:
```ruby
other_frame = TimeFrame.new(
  min: time_frame.min - 3.days,
  max: time_frame.min + 40.minutes
)
time_frame.overlaps?(other_frame)
# => true
```

Time frame without another time frame:
```ruby
time_frame = TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 5, 12), duration: 1.day)
other = TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 5, 12, 19), duration: 10.minutes)
time_frame.without(other)
# [2014-05-12 00:00:00 +0200..2014-05-12 19:00:00 +0200,
#  2014-05-12 19:10:00 +0200..2014-05-13 00:00:00 +0200]
```

You can also use without with many TimeFrame's:
```ruby
another = other.shift_by(15.minutes)
time_frame.without(other, another)
# [2014-05-12 00:00:00 +0200..2014-05-12 19:00:00 +0200,
#  2014-05-12 19:10:00 +0200..2014-05-12 19:15:00 +0200,
#  2014-05-12 19:25:00 +0200..2014-05-13 00:00:00 +0200]
```

Use of the mathematical &. The intersection is returned:
```ruby
time_frame = TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014), duration: 1.day)
other_time_frame = time_frame.shift_by(12.hours)
time_frame & other_time_frame
# => 2014-01-01 12:00:00 +0100..2014-01-02 00:00:00 +0100
```

These are the most common functionalities of the `TimeFrame` class, but there is quite more to discover. If you have an array of time frames, you can compute their union and pairwise intersection using `TimeFrame.union` and `TimeFrame.intersection`. For two sorted arrays of time frames, you can traverse all overlaps of time frames in the first array with time frames in the second array in **linear time** using `TimeFrame.each_overlap`.

```ruby

# each_overlap in a real life sample:

husband_at_home = [
  TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 2, 1), duration: 2.days),
  TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 5, 1), duration: 4.days),
  TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 7, 1), duration: 10.days)
]

mother_in_law_visits = [
  TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 2, 2), duration: 1.days),
  TimeFrame.new(min: Time.new(2014, 7, 3), duration: 2.days)
]

TimeFrame.each_overlap(mother_in_law_visits, husband_at_home) do |overlap|
  puts "Houston... we have a problem... from #{overlap.min} to #{overlap.max}"
end

```

## Usage with ActiveRecord
When you want tu use TimeFrame with active record you need to define and initialize a PredicateHandler. Assuming you want to use this feature in a model called VogonPoen < ActiveRecord::Base you can do this as follows:
```ruby
class TimeFrame
  # This class tells the active_record predicate builder how to handle
  # time_frame classes when passed into a where-clause
  class PredicateBuilderHandler

    def initialize(model)
      @model = model
      model
        .predicate_builder
        .register_handler(TimeFrame, proc do |column, time_frame|
          column.in(time_frame.min..time_frame.max)
        end)

    end
  end
end

TimeFrame::PredicateBuilderHandler.new(VogonPoem)

poem_min = VogonPoem.create(written_at: time_frame.min)
poem_max = VogonPoem.create(written_at: time_frame.max)

result = VogonPoem.where(written_at: time_frame)

# The following specs will hold:

# expect(result.count).to eq 2
# expect(result.first).to eq poem_min
# expect(result.last).to eq poem_max
```

## Does `TimeFrame` inherit from `Range`?
No. Ruby's `Range` class is multi-purpose, it can hold contiuous values (like floats), as well as discrete values (like integers) and behaves differently according to their type. Instance methods like `#each` or `#size` just don't make sense for time values, the same is true for all methods provided by the `Enumerable` mixin.
